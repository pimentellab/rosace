**Rosace** is a Bayesian framework developed for analyzing growth-based deep mutational scanning (DMS) data. It effectively controls for the false discovering rate and increases power in DMS experiments with small sample sizes by leveraging amino acid residue information and mean-variance shrinkage. **Rosace** also contains a simulation framework **Rosette** that simulates the distributional properties of DMS, providing a reliable benchmark for evaluating DMS analysis tools.

**Rosace** is developed and maintained by the [Pimentel lab](https://pimentellab.com/). Details about the program can be found at:

**Rosace** is avaliable as a an R package. To get started, [download the software]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/) and explore the [vignettes page]({{ site.baseurl }}/vignettes/) for guidance on its usage.
