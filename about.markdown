**Rosace** is a Bayesian framework developed for analyzing growth-based deep mutational scanning (DMS) data. 
It effectively controls for the false discovering rate in DMS experiments with small sample sizes by leveraging amino acid position information. **Rosace** also contains a simulation framework **Rosette** that simulates the distributional properties of DMS, providing a reliable benchmark for evaluating DMS analysis tools.

**Rosace** is developed and maintained by the [Pimentel lab](https://pimentellab.com/). Details about the program can be found in our [preprint]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html):
